* Dynamic Route53 - Uses the `AWSPowerShell` module to automatically update a hosted zone record with your public IP address. Useful for when you do not have a static IP and don't want to run a precompiled package from a third party.
* Workflow Killer - Stops the running Nintex workflow and resets the document permissions to inherit.
* Nintex WorkflowHistoryList Cleanup++ - Cleans up the Nintex WorkflowHistory list when it's grown beyond a functional size. May not work out of the box and require some setup for your environment.
